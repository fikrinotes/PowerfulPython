# What Is This ? 
This is a Python program that functions to calculate basic values ​​in elementary statistics such as averages, populations, and so on.  I created this program because I was tired of using a calculator in calculations, especially with all the limitations that a calculator has.  In addition, this can also be used as an exercise for me in learning python further. 

I created this program with a little help from the numPy library.
